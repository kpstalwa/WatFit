# WatFit - An IOS Fitness Application

WatFit is a fitness app that uses motion sensing capabilities of the IPhone to both provide guidance on various excercises, as well as assess your form to provide a complete overiew of how effective your workout is. 

# Progress So far:
- UI work is done, as well as the general structure of the app.
- Organized classes to reflect template design behaviour
- Motion sensing allows for good or bad reps depending on 'wrong' initial angle, or outstanding acceleration detected via gyroscope and accelerometer.
- Appropriate visual and (soon) audio cues for the technique you use.
- Rest period, and allows for changing reps and sets mid rest.
- Scoring mechanism for final feedback
